# Retell Custom LLM Python Demo

This is a demo of using Retell with a custom LLM in Python. The demo shows how to integrate Retell with OpenAI's API to create a voice AI agent for a burger restaurant ordering system.

## Features

- Real-time voice conversation with an AI agent
- Streaming responses for a more natural conversation flow
- Function calling support for more complex interactions
- Burger restaurant ordering system with natural language understanding
  - Understand spoken orders with quantities (e.g., "three burgers")
  - Confirm orders with callers
  - Handle customization options (cooking preferences, cheese types, toppings)
  - Provide order summaries
  - Suggest add-ons for items in the order
  - Handle order corrections
  - Suggest combo meals and drinks
  - Take customer name for the order
  - Confirm pickup or delivery preference
  - Provide estimated preparation time

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   RETELL_API_KEY=your_retell_api_key
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.server:app --reload
   ```

## Burger Restaurant Ordering System

The ordering system is designed to process natural language spoken orders from customers for a burger restaurant called "Burger Bliss". It includes:

1. **Natural Language Understanding**: The system can understand spoken orders and extract relevant information such as items, quantities, and modifiers.

2. **Order Confirmation**: After processing an order, the system will confirm it with the customer to ensure accuracy.

3. **Customization Handling**: The system can handle various customization options:
   - Cooking preferences (rare, medium-rare, medium, medium-well, well-done)
   - Cheese types (American, Cheddar, Swiss, Pepper Jack, Blue Cheese)
   - Toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, jalape√±os, mushrooms, special sauce, mayo, ketchup, mustard)
   - Sizes (small, medium, large)

4. **Order Summary**: The system provides a summary of the order, including all items and their modifiers.

5. **Add-on Suggestions**: The system suggests add-ons for items in the order, such as "Would you like cheese with your burger?"

6. **Combo Suggestions**: The system suggests combo meals when appropriate, such as "Would you like to make that a combo with fries and a drink for just $3 more?"

7. **Drink Suggestions**: The system suggests drinks if not already ordered.

8. **Order Corrections**: The system can handle corrections to the order, such as "No, it's two cheeseburgers and three fries."

9. **Customer Information**: The system takes the customer's name for the order and confirms pickup or delivery preference.

10. **Preparation Time**: The system provides an estimated preparation time for the order.

### How It Works

The ordering system consists of two main components:

1. **OrderHandler**: This class is responsible for processing orders and extracting information from the conversation transcript.

2. **OrderLlmClient**: This class extends the base LLM client to integrate with the order handling system.

The system uses a combination of rule-based processing and LLM-based responses to handle orders effectively.
